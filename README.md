#Flutter REST API Call
This project demonstrates how to make REST API calls in a Flutter application. The application fetches, displays, and interacts with data from a RESTful web service.

#Features
HTTP Requests: Utilizes the http package to perform HTTP requests to a REST API.
JSON Parsing: Parses JSON responses from the API to Dart objects using jsonDecode.
State Management: Manages application state using setState for a clean and maintainable codebase.
Asynchronous Programming: Handles asynchronous operations using Future and async/await.
Error Handling: Implements robust error handling for network requests and API responses.
